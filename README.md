ðŸ¤— Text Classifier using Hugging Face Transformers
This project demonstrates how to use the powerful Hugging Face transformers library to create a text classifier. It leverages pretrained language models like BERT, DistilBERT, or RoBERTa and fine-tunes them for classification tasks such as sentiment analysis or topic detection.
